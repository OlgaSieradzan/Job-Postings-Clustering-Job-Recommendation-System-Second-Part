🤖 Job Recommendation System - Phase 2: Data Engineering & Clustering

Building on the insights from Phase 1, this repository focuses on the technical "heavy lifting." We move from understanding the data to transforming it into a machine-learning-ready format and executing our first segmentation.

🚀 Phase 2 Overview

In this stage, the raw dataset was refined into a high-quality analytical table. The core of this phase is Clustering—grouping job offers based on shared characteristics to lay the groundwork for a robust recommendation engine.

🛠️ What’s Inside?

Advanced Data Cleaning: Handling outliers, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing features to ensure mathematical consistency.

Feature Engineering: Creating an analytical table optimized for high-dimensional data.

Clustering Pre-requisites: Verifying assumptions (like feature scaling and dimensionality check) to ensure the data is suitable for grouping.

Cluster Analysis: Implementing and evaluating clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means, DBSCAN) to discover hidden patterns in job listings.
